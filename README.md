# Subgroup-Discovery-on-Random-Forest
Subgroup discovery method is applied to random forest in order to select subgroups of entities in the dataset, which seems to be able to approximate with a single random tree. This provides us with the interpretable subgroups of dataset, which makes the random forest model less black-box than usual.
